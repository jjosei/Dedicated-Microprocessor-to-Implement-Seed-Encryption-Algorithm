# Dedicated-Microprocessor-to-Implement-Seed-Encryption-Algorithm
The aim of this project is to successfully design and program a microprocessor to which can successfully implement both encryption and decryption of the seed encryption algorithm on an FPGA using VHDL.

**Design Methodology <br />**
-Xilinx ISE used for design using VHDL <br />
-The processor consists of a Datapath and Control Unit. <br />

**Synthesis and Implementation For FPGA  <br />**
-Design synthesised correctly for the retired Xilinx Spartan 3 FPGA <br />
-The spartan 3 can be used as reference when deciding an FPGA for synthesis/implementation of this project. <br />
